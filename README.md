## Day - 01 : `Variable and Data Types`

### Learnings
* Use `const` only when we want to prevent the data from modification.

* In other cases prefer to use `let` and `var`.

* Among `let` and `var` prefer `let`, as `var`have some issues related to scoping. Use `var` only when you have to support old version of browsers.

* `typeof()` operator is useful for knowing the type of the variable.

* We can console log the data in the tabular format using `console.table()`
